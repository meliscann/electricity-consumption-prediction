## ⚙️ **How Does the Program and Model Run?**
1️⃣ **Load and Preprocess the Data:**
- Load the dataset (e.g., from a file).
- Handle missing values, normalize/scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables if necessary.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## 2️⃣ **Define the Model:**
- Specify the machine learning algorithm to be used (e.g., ANN, Random Forest, etc.).
- Configure model parameters as required.

## 3️⃣ **Train the Model:**
- Fit the model to the training data.
- Monitor metrics like loss or accuracy during the training process to evaluate performance.

## 4️⃣ **Make Predictions:**
- Use the trained model to predict outcomes for new or unseen data.

## 5️⃣ **Visualize and Interpret Results:**
- Generate plots (e.g., feature importance, prediction vs. actual values) to understand the model's behavior.
- Provide insights based on the predictions and evaluation metrics.

## 📈 **Results**
The ANN model was trained for **25 epochs** and evaluated using **MSE and MAE**. The model provides meaningful predictions and insights for optimizing energy consumption.
