# **Electricity Consumption Prediction with Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict household electricity consumption using machine learning techniques. By analyzing power usage, voltage, and sub-metering data, the model provides accurate forecasts that enable efficient energy management.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and structuring raw energy consumption data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing consumption patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented using TensorFlow.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Visualization:** Graphs to analyze model performance and consumption trends.

## ðŸ“Œ **Technologies Used**
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- RapidMiner
- 
## **Dataset**
The dataset used is obtained from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and contains minute-level electricity consumption data.

## **Results**
The ANN model was trained for **25 epochs** and evaluated using **MSE and MAE**. The model provides meaningful predictions and insights for optimizing energy consumption.
